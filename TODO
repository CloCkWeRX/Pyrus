TODO:

Implement array access for registry so you can use isset($reg['pear.php.net/Validate']), or
    $info = $reg['pear.php.net/Validate'];

Collect contributor data on files copied from PEAR to request permission to change license.

Separate out filetransactions as the other three are currently?

Declare depdendencies on PEAR2_HTTP_Request, PEAR2_Autoload, PEAR2_Exception - add to package.xml

Package-2.0 and 2.1 xsd needs to be relaxed a bit to allow flexible ordering of elements.
    Some ideas - change sequence to choice and enumerate the possible sequences within the choice,
    this will make a very large xsd, but may work. Something we need to try out.
