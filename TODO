TODO:

[X] Implement array access for registry so you can use isset($reg['pear.php.net/Validate']), or
    $info = $reg['pear.php.net/Validate'];

Declare dependencies on PEAR2_HTTP_Request, PEAR2_Autoload, PEAR2_Exception - add to package.xml

Package-2.0 and 2.1 xsd needs to be relaxed a bit to allow flexible ordering of elements.
    Some ideas - change sequence to choice and enumerate the possible sequences within the choice,
    this will make a very large xsd, but may work. Something we need to try out.

Try out the how the Pyrus_Config::locateLocalSettingsDirectory handles if a settings dir is changed
this will mostly be a test of what approach in COM will suit us best

 [X] Sync OSGuess from pear to pyrus
Rewrite it ?

Add true command line argument parsing for the script frontend

Update Sqlite3 to use the new exception mode, and to use bindValue() instead of bindParam()

Add PEAR 1.x configuration parsing to Pear1 registry, in order to use these values for PEAR 1.x packages.
    Decide how to handle the conflict, especially with php_dir being different, as it will be "php" for
    all PEAR 1.x packages.

Fully implement plugin system for custom roles, tasks and commands
    plugin_dir config variable already exists, we need to create a plugin-specific
    Sqlite3 registry, which extends the Sqlite3 registry and adds the plugin
    tables, and then have a check at load-in for plugins to load as needed.

Fully implement and test post-install scripts

Implement PECL package install
    Unlike PEAR, we will install PECL packages and implement these new commands:
    build - compile the extension and install it (this is implicit with "install/upgrade")
    clean - equivalent to "make clean" which iterates over the source directory and cleans all
            files not in package.xml
    This will allow much easier debugging of broken pecl compiles

Finish implementing remote channel REST iteration for maintainers/categories
