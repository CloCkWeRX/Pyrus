Pyrus is the package manager and installer for PHP 5.3 or newer

Pyrus provides the means to install and manage installations for
packages built using package.xml version 2.0 or newer.  Pyrus is
redesigned from the ground up for PHP 5.3 or newer, and provides
significant improvements over the older PEAR Installer.

To use Pyrus, in this development series of releases, you need to
instantiate a simple script that creates a package and installs it:

<?php
// use full path if include_path is not set up
use pear2\Pyrus
include 'PEAR2/Autoload.php';
$config = Pyrus\Config::singleton('/where/to/install');
// this can be a url to a remote package, a local .tgz, .zip or package.xml
$p = new Pyrus\Package('thingtoinstall');
try {
    Pyrus\Installer::begin();
    Pyrus\Installer::prepare($p);
    Pyrus\Installer::commit();
} catch (Exception $e) {
    Pyrus\Installer::rollback();
    echo $e;
}
?>
