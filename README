Pyrus is the package manager and installer for PHP 5.3 or newer

Pyrus provides the means to install and manage installations for
packages built using package.xml version 2.0 or newer.  Pyrus is
redesigned from the ground up for PHP 5.3 or newer, and provides
significant improvements over the older PEAR Installer.

To use Pyrus, you can download pyrus.phar from the PEAR2 website,
and execute it from the command line:
$ php pyrus.phar install PEAR2_Templates_Savant-alpha

You can also install PEAR2_Pyrus to access the API for installing
and managing packages. Once installed, a convenience script is
available from the command line.
$ pyrus install PEAR2_Templates_Savant-alpha
